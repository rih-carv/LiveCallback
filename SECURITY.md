## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email me at rih.carv@gmail.com, providing concise steps to reproduce the vulnerability found.
I will reply as soon as possible.

I will do my best to address the issue, and you can expect it to be shipped on the next released
versions, as soon as it's been fixed.

### Disclosure

To protect our community, I ask that you wait until a fix is made available and communicated to
those affected, or a reasonable period of time has elapsed since notification, before publicly
disclosing it. Also, I will fill a security advisory once the details are known.
